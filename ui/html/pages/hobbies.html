                    <p class="text-light text-oliveGreen md:col-span-2">I've spending my time recently learning Go and studying system design along with DSA. I've recently finished going through the <a href="https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/" target="_blank" class="font-bold">Let's Go</a> book and have implemented a simple enough CRUD app
                        with a MySQL database to store user signup/login data and a middleware layer that handles user auth and session creation, request logging, CSRF security, common headers per request along with some front-end templating, caching and centralized error handling. <br>
                        I've also taken the time to make this site which uses Go and TailwindCSS in order to learn how to make sites look (more) professional. Or at least presentable. All in efforts to be able to create systems of my own and understand them better.<br>
                        I'm in the process of expanding my breadth while building additional depth tied to back-end implementation. Plus I want to enjoy what I'm doing. I'm on a quest to find and expand on the things I like about creating software.<br>

                    <p class="text-light text-oliveGreen md:col-span-3">I also decided to become a DJ and I've been at it for the past 7 years or so. Not professionally, but my hobby has taken me to different parts of the world and I'll always be grateful for that. It has also contributed to my growth in different ways. Talking on the mic as someone who's more of an introvert type took some time, but we got there.<br>
                        My hobby helped me realize I can succeed at most things with enough dedication and consistency. You never know what direction something will go. I try to apply that to other areas of my life as well.

                        Similar to writing code, it's creative and requires structure</p>
