      I enjoy the combination of creativity and organization that is required
      for a highly functional and visually appealing product to come to life.
      Over time, I’ve realized that I find joy in loosing track of time while
      turning ideas into organized and clean solutions through code. All the
      while, thinking about how the human that will be interacting with this
      thing is going to feel about it at the end of the day. I value growth -
      technical and otherwise. I’m big on visualization and creating systems to
      materialize the vision into reality. I value encouragement and belief,
      toward one-self and others.<br /><br />

      I’m a senior software engineer with 9 years of experience primarily in
      fullstack development. My current work involves developing on-prem and
      cloud web applications for different clients using Go and Vue.js along
      with Docker containerization and high level system design. In the past
      I've had the opportunity to work on modernizing and maintaining
      user-centric logic tied to global navigation elements within schwab.com, a
      job that required consistent communication with over 7 different tech
      teams and knowledge in C# .NET Core as well as Typescript and React. I’ve
      also had the opportunity to implement CI/CD pipelines for multiple teams
      and write a few in-house tools with Java and Spring Boot.<br /><br />

      I’m also investing time into learning about branding and business
      promotion through web design on my own. I'm discovering I enjoy the
      product design aspect of the prodcess along with the technical design
      side. Outside of technology, I’m implementing different habits that have
      taken a while to come into action, but I’m finally here. Meditation in the
      mornings, journaling on the weekends, rebuilding my relationship with
      money and being more patient with...me. Life. Change takes time.
      <br /><br />

      When I have the extra time, I enjoy going to the coffee shop to re-group
      and take a look at what direction I’m taking with my life. I used to game
      quite a bit in my earlier years, now I play the occasional Diablo IV
      (currently thinking about getting the steam deck, but not fully sold
      yet!)<br /><br />

      I also very much enjoy music - live and otherwise. What started off as a
      dance hobby evolved into a DJ hobby and eventually into a passion for
      music production. Feel free to
