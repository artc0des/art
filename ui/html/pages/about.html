            <p class="text-oliveGreen pb-10 font-light text-sm md:text-xl">My name's Arturo (you can call me Art).<br> I'm a software engineer with 8 years of experience, primarily in back-end development and working
                on expanding my design and front-end knowledge in order to create things that work but also look good.<br>
                I consider myself a creative, both professionally and outside of work and so I'm on a journey to find the best way to express that through individual projects that ideally help others in some way. 
                This page is meant to give you a glimpse into who I am, what I can do, what I've done in my career and more importantly, it represents a decision to share more.
