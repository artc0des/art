            <p class="text-oliveGreen pb-10 font-light text-sm md:text-xl">I am a individual contributor/coder who wants to help others in my team through mentorship. 
                                                I am mainly driven by the people I get to work with, the companyâ€™s vision also has some weight on my drive. 
                                                I like to implement solutions as they come to mind and continue to iterate on them. 
                                                I value my independence at work and want to figure things out and successfully implement solutions while learning a ton. 
                                                My interests lie in understanding the system as a whole. 
                                                I enjoy designing a slick user experience while being able to connect the front-end to a back-end logic layer to achieve the end goal. 
                                                A generalist. I want to contribute to a growing company where the product market fit has been identified and growth is ongoing. 
                                                I also like the idea of overcoming my fear of judgement and leaning into sharing my own ideas and bringing them to fruition while sharing my (imperfect) journey.</p>
