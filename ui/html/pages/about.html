                I enjoy the combination of creativity and organization that is required for a highly functional and visually appealing product to come to life. Over time, I’ve realized that I find joy in loosing track of time while turning ideas into organized and clean solutions through code.
                All the while, thinking about how the human that will be interacting with this thing at the end of day is going to feel about it. 
                I value consistent growth - technical and otherwise. I’m big on visualization and creating systems to materialize the vision into reality. I value encouragement and belief, toward one-self and others.<br><br>

                I’m a senior software engineer with 8 years of experience primarily in the finance sector. My current work involves modernizing and maintaining user-centric logic tied to global navigation elements within schwab.com, a job that requires consistent communication with over 7 different tech teams and knowledge in C# .NET Core as well as Typescript and React.
                I’ve also had the opportunity to implement CI/CD pipelines for multiple teams and write a few in-house tools with Java and Spring Boot.<br><br>

                I’m also investing time into learning Go 1.24 on my own and how to properly implement APIs that connect to user facing UIs using TailwindCSS and HTMX. I’ve learned to implement several features under the hood, such as, middleware for incoming request tracking and monitoring, async rate limiting per user IP, 
                graceful shutdown procedures for unexpected panics and user authentication/authorization using JWT or sessions along with email confirmations upon registration.  I’ve been using PostgreSQL in the persistence layer to get familiarized with full-text search and sorting/pagination techniques in Go. Outside of technology, I’m implementing different habits that have taken a while to come into action, but I’m finally here. Meditation in the mornings, journaling at night, rebuilding my relationship with money and being more patient with...me. Life. <br><br>

                When I have the extra time, I enjoy going to the coffee shop to re-group and take a look at what direction I’m taking with my life. I used to game quite a bit in my earlier years, now I play the occasional Diablo IV
                (currently thinking about getting the steam deck, but not fully sold yet!)<br><br>

                I also very much enjoy music - live and otherwise. What started off as a dance hobby evolved into a DJ hobby and eventually into a passion for music production.
